                        <strong>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</strong>
                    </div>
                    <div class="collapse-content"> 
                      <p><strong>var:</strong> Imagine var as a bit forgetful. When you declare a variable with var, it might forget where it was defined. It has what's called "function scope", meaning it's accessible throughout the whole function in which it was created. <br>

                        <strong>let:</strong> Now, let is a bit more cautious. It only remembers where it was defined inside the block it belongs to. This is what we call "block scope". So, it's like it has a more limited memory compared to var. <br>
                        
                        <strong>const:</strong> Const is like a rock-solid memory. Once you define something with const, it stays that way. You can't reassign it to something else. It's also block scoped, just like let.</p>

                  <div class="collapse collapse-plus bg-base-200">
                    <input type="radio" name="my-accordion-3" /> 
                    <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
                        <strong>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</strong>
                    </div>
                    <div class="collapse-content"> 
                      <p><strong>null:</strong> Think of null as an intentional empty space. It's like saying, "I know there's a spot for something here, but right now, it's empty on purpose." For example, if you have a slot for a username, but the user hasn't provided it yet, you might set it to null. <br>

                        <strong>undefined:</strong> Undefined is like a blank space that you didn't even mean to leave empty. It means no value has been assigned to a variable yet. So, if you declare a variable but forget to give it a value, it'll be undefined.</p>

                        <strong>What do you mean by REST API?</strong>
                    </div>
                    <div class="collapse-content"> 
                      <p>Alright, imagine a restaurant. You, as a customer, don't need to know all the intricate details of how the kitchen works. You just need to know how to place your order and get your food. That's what a REST API is like.
                        <br>
                        It stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. In simple terms, it's a way for different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. It's like a menu in a restaurant. You request something (like a dish), and the kitchen (server) prepares it and serves it to you.
                        <br>
                        For example, when you use a weather app on your phone, it sends a request to a server somewhere on the internet, asking for the current weather. The server processes this request and sends back the weather information, which your app then displays to you.
                        <br>
                        So, a REST API defines a set of rules for how these requests and responses should be structured and what kind of information can be exchanged. It's like a common language that different software can use to talk to each other.
